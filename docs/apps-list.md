ARM32/ARM64
```
OpenSCAD is software for creating solid 3D CAD models.

Unlike most free software for creating 3D models, OpenSCAD does not focus on
the artistic aspects of 3D modelling but instead on the CAD aspects.
OpenSCAD is more suitable for creating 3D models of machine parts but
perhaps not when creating computer-animated movies.

OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. Instead OpenSCAD is something like
a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the object
and renders the 3D model from this script file. This gives designers
full control over the modelling process and enables them to easily
change any step in the modelling process or make designs that are
defined by configurable parameters.

HTTrack is a free and easy-to-use offline browser utility.

It allows you to download a World Wide Web site from the Internet to a local directory, building recursively all directories, getting HTML, images, and other files from the server to your computer. HTTrack arranges the original site's relative link-structure. Simply open a page of the "mirrored" website in your browser, and you can browse the site from link to link, as if you were viewing it online. HTTrack can also update an existing mirrored site, and resume interrupted downloads. HTTrack is fully configurable, and has an integrated help system. 

This will also install WebHTTrack, which is a graphical version of HTTrack that uses a locally served website as a GUI.

To run HTTrack:
Run from Terminal: httrack

To run WebHTTrack (graphical version of HTTrack):
Run from Terminal: webhttrack

Lokinet is a privacy focused network anyone can access using the latest in decentralized onion routing technology.

Lokinet requires no internet IP Address but instead provides it's own network addresses which can be either ephemeral, persistent or personalized depending on the users desired application. Information is onion routed through a globally distributed network of over one thousand nodes.

Hosting on Lokinet is quite easy and allows users to instantly create static addresses that can be privately accessed remotely over the internet for hosting their own online content. Using a Lokinet "SNApp" alleviates many of the challenges associated with hosting when it comes to configuring ports on a network. WIth SNApps there are no ports to forward. SNApps can be easily hosted on as little as an SBC inside a network and privately accessible anywhere in the world. SNApps also can hosted on a VPN using webservers such as Nginx, Apache, python etc. thereby allowing private anonymized global access your own personal content or sharing content privately among other users of the network. Web based applications such as IRC, Mumble, PeerTube, Pleroma, forums, streaming content etc. are all supportable through the network. The location and origin of the server is hidden and users anonymized while additionally the server can be secured in traditional ways. One can also register custom domains if they so choose to but this is not required to immediately generate a static address.

Users wishing to access the regular internet anonymously need not pay for access to use Lokinet but may chose to subscribe to an exit provider should they wish to enhance anonymous access the internet through such a provider. Additionally the network generally has free exit nodes available offered through individuals providing voluntary support to the network.

Currently the Oxen Privacy Tech Foundation offers free Lokinet exit node access at address "exit.loki". A wiki for Lokinet is located at https://wiki.oxen.io/wiki/Main_Page

Open-source version of Google Chrome.
If you are using Raspberry Pi OS, this browser has been optimized by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to include hardware acceleration and other various performance improvements.

To play Netflix, Spotify, or other protected multimedia streams, see the Chromium Widevine app.
To install an older version of Chromium, see the Downgrade Chromium app.

Chromium supports numerous flags to enable extra features. You can add these flags either manually (by running chromium-browser in a terminal), or by adding the flag to a file in the /etc/chromium/customizations folder.
Here's how that works: Inside the /etc/chromium/customizations folder there will be one or more files. On most systems there will already be a 00-rpi-vars file there. You can add flags to it, or create a new file. In all cases, be sure it starts with:
CHROMIUM_FLAGS="${CHROMIUM_FLAGS}
And be sure it ends with this character: "

Now that you know how to add flags to Chromium, here are some useful ones:
- Enable Google Chrome Sync: --oauth2-client-id=77185425430.apps.googleusercontent.com --oauth2-client-secret=OTJgUOQcT7lO7GsGZq2G4IlT
    This flag is discussed in the Raspberry Pi Forums: https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=314477
- Enable dark mode: --force-dark-mode
    If you want more themes, go visit the Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/themes
- Change the scale of the browser window: --force-device-scale-factor=1.3
    The default is 1 - smaller values will shrink the interface, while larger values will grow the interface.
- More chromium flags can be found on this website: https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches
```

Chromium 65, 72, 74, 78, 84, 86, 88, 92, and 95.
Uninstall the app to go back to the latest Chromium version available.
Beware that downgrading Chromium versions can mess up your config folder. To be safe, this app makes a backup of Chromium's config folder. When uninstalling, you will have the opportunity to restore the backup config folder.
Using older browser versions can be a security risk, proceed with caution.

Feature-rich screen recorder for X11 and OpenGL
Simple Screen Recorder is, despite its name, an actually feature-rich screen recorder. The name reflects the fact that it is simple to use unlike many other free screen recording applications available. It can be easily configured to start recording from an intuitive wizard-like interface.

It can record the entire screen or part of it directly.  The recording can be paused and resumed at any time. Many different file formats and codecs are supported. To perform an X11 recording, all it takes is selecting an area on the root window with the mouse, choosing an output file and pressing record, either by using the mouse or using a hotkey.

It has a Qt-based graphical user interface.

Its complexity becomes apparent in its powerful features. It allows one to record X11 screen areas and fullscreen OpenGL applications including sound supporting both ALSA, PulseAudio, JACK and OSS. It uses libavformat to encode the recorded material into a variety of video formats. Scaling the recorded video is possible as well as configuring the encoding quality for the codec chosen directly from the user interface.

If you are using a 32-bit OS:
- You will have to enable the 64-bit kernel. Don't worry, enabling it will not harm your OS - you probably won't even notice.
- A 64-bit Debian Bullseye chroot will be created. (/opt/wps-office-chroot)
- The total installation will take 2.1GB of space.
- To run in a terminal: schroot -c wps-office-chroot -- wps
- If you trust WPS Office and want to use its Internet features, then run this command: sudo cp /etc/resolv.conf /opt/wps-office-chroot/etc/resolv.conf

If you are using a 64-bit OS:
- WPS will be directly installed with apt.
- The total installation will take 1.3GB of space.
- To run in a terminal: wps
- If you trust WPS Office and want to use its Internet features, edit the menu button and get rid of the "firejail --net=none" part.

Of course Pi-Apps lets you download more RAM!
Have you ever been using your Raspberry Pi when the screen froze? Most likely, your system ran out of RAM.
On default Raspbian, freezes happen easily and suddenly. When the RAM fills up, the entire system becomes unresponsive. Many people think the only solution is to buy a Pi with more RAM, but THAT'S NOT TRUE and this app proves it.

This app uses ZRAM to increase the capacity of your RAM. ZRAM is a kernel module to compress data on-the-fly and store it in RAM. It has all sorts of uses, but it can be an extremely performant Swap drive with the right tweaks.

Some types of data compress better than others. On average, the ZSTD algorithm reaches a 3:1 compression-ratio, but in some cases it can approach 5:1! When used as Swap, this means that theoretically, one RAM chip can store 5 times as much memory! While real-world loads are unlikely to be compressible that much, the results are still impressive. In a recent test, Chromium was instructed to open 200 tabs. (mostly youtube videos)
When everything finished loading, Chromium had consumed 7GB of RAM. However, this test was performed on a Raspberry Pi 4 with only 4GB of RAM! Without ZRAM, the screen would have frozen within seconds. But with ZRAM, the system was still very responsive.

What does this app do?
- This app will disable the default Swapfile. (By default, RPiOS comes with a pitiful 100MB swapfile that does barely anything) Disabling Swap reduces the number of writes to the SD card, boosting performance while increasing its lifetime.
- This app will setup ZRAM to extend the usable RAM, when necessary. How much ZRAM? It's calculated based on a 4:1 ratio of your devices available RAM. On a 1GB Pi, there will be 4GB of ZRAM; on a 4GB Pi there will be 16GB of ZRAM. Remember: this relies on compressing data, so some situations may not be able to reach the full 4:1 compression-ratio.
- This app will adjust a few kernel paremeters to optimize RAM usage.
- Remember how ZRAM can be used for other things too? This app will also set up some high speed data storage using ZRAM. It's perfect for managing large files temporarily, without filling up your SD card. This is similar to a RAMdisk, but it doesn't use the RAM as quickly. You can access this storage by going to the new /zram folder.
Of course, uninstalling this app will revert everything back to how it was.

How do I know if it's working? There are a few ways to check.
- You can run the htop command to see RAM and Swap usage. Htop will refresh itself every second, just like the Task Manager.
- You can install Conky from Pi-Apps. This will display the RAM and Swap usage on the desktop. Conky refreshes twice every second.
- To see more detailed ZRAM information and statistics, run the zramctl command.

What about Novaspirit Tech's popular ZRAM tutorial from a few years ago? Is this app better? Yes. First, Novaspirit created four swapdisks, while only one is necessary. Also, he used LZ4 compression, while this app uses the new ZSTD compression algorithm. (ZSTD is slightly slower than LZ4, but its compression ratio is far better) Also, he didn't tweak any kernel parameters, severaly limiting ZRAM's effectiveness.

Overall, this app is designed to get the most out of ZRAM. Even if your Pi never uses all available RAM, installing this app will unlock more space for file-caching, thereby improving performance while reducing writes to the SD card.

It's as simple as that. WoR-flasher takes care of the rest - downloading hundreds of files from Microsoft, generating a Windows image with them, importing the custom RPi drivers, enabling the WinPE environment, and much more. When finished, WoR-flasher will tell you exactly what to do next.

To run: Menu -> Accessories -> WoR-Flasher
To run the graphical interface in a terminal: ~/wor-flasher/install-wor-gui.sh
To run the command-line interface in a terminal: ~/wor-flasher/install-wor.sh

If you encounter problems, we recommend you run WoR-flasher in a terminal to catch any errors.

```
Easily emulate x86_64 linux apps on Raspberry Pi.

Box64 lets you run x86_64 Linux programs (such as games) on non-x86_64 Linux systems, like ARM (host system needs to be 64bit little-endian).

Because Box64 uses the native versions of some "system" libraries, like libc, libm, SDL, and OpenGL, it's easy to integrate and use with most applications, and performance can be surprisingly high in many cases.

Easily emulate x86 linux apps on Raspberry Pi.
Box86 lets you run x86 Linux programs (such as games) on non-x86 Linux, like ARM (host system needs to be 32bit little-endian).
Because Box86 uses the native versions of some "system" libraries, like libc, libm, SDL and OpenGL, it's easy to integrate and use, and performance can be surprisingly high in some cases.
Box86 now integrates a DynaRec (dynamic recompiler) for the ARM platform, providing a speed boost between 5 to 10 times faster than only using the interpreter.

QEMU is a generic and open source machine emulator and virtualizer.
Latest version of QEMU, Not outdated like the repository's QEMU.
If you ever had trouble using the repository's QEMU, this version will work way better.
(for example the MacOS 9 dock doesn't appear using the repository's QEMU).

ARM32 ONLY
```
Run x86 Windows apps with a box86-emulated version of x86 wine.
To run: wine path/to/file.exe
To configure wine: go to 'Wine configuration' in main menu or type in terminal: wine winecfg
Not all Windows applications will work under Wine. It's a good idea to check online if your program can run, or if something can be tweaked to make it work.

Note: the applications installed with wine will appear under the wine category in the main menu, and they will stay there even after uninstalling wine.

Need support with running a game or app with wine and box86? Ask it on the Pi Labs Discord: https://discord.gg/JKNQXprqUd
