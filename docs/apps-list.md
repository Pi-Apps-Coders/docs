ARM32/ARM64

    OpenSCAD is software for creating solid 3D CAD models.
    
    Unlike most free software for creating 3D models, OpenSCAD does not focus on
    the artistic aspects of 3D modelling but instead on the CAD aspects.
    OpenSCAD is more suitable for creating 3D models of machine parts but
    perhaps not when creating computer-animated movies.
    
    OpenSCAD is not an interactive modeller. Instead OpenSCAD is something like
    a 3D-compiler that reads in a script file that describes the object
    and renders the 3D model from this script file. This gives designers
    full control over the modelling process and enables them to easily
    change any step in the modelling process or make designs that are
    defined by configurable parameters.

    In most cases, Chiaki will automatically detect your console if it's turned on. Otherwise, you can add it manually by pressing the "+" icon (top right) and entering your console's IP address.
    
    To finalize the registration, two more parameters need to be set.
    PSN AccountID: In a terminal, enter "python3 Chiaki/psn-account-id.py" and follow the instructions.
    Registration PIN:
    On a PS4, go to: Settings -> Remote Play -> Add Device;
    On a PS5, go to: Settings -> System -> Remote Play -> Link Device.
    
    You can now double-click your console in Chiaki's main window to start remote play!

https://optf.ngo/<br />
ARM32/ARM64

    Lokinet is a privacy focused network anyone can access using the latest in decentralized onion routing technology.
    
    Lokinet requires no internet IP Address but instead provides it's own network addresses which can be either ephemeral, persistent or personalized depending on the users desired application. Information is onion routed through a globally distributed network of over one thousand nodes.
    
    Hosting on Lokinet is quite easy and allows users to instantly create static addresses that can be privately accessed remotely over the internet for hosting their own online content. Using a Lokinet "SNApp" alleviates many of the challenges associated with hosting when it comes to configuring ports on a network. WIth SNApps there are no ports to forward. SNApps can be easily hosted on as little as an SBC inside a network and privately accessible anywhere in the world. SNApps also can hosted on a VPN using webservers such as Nginx, Apache, python etc. thereby allowing private anonymized global access your own personal content or sharing content privately among other users of the network. Web based applications such as IRC, Mumble, PeerTube, Pleroma, forums, streaming content etc. are all supportable through the network. The location and origin of the server is hidden and users anonymized while additionally the server can be secured in traditional ways. One can also register custom domains if they so choose to but this is not required to immediately generate a static address.
    
    Users wishing to access the regular internet anonymously need not pay for access to use Lokinet but may chose to subscribe to an exit provider should they wish to enhance anonymous access the internet through such a provider. Additionally the network generally has free exit nodes available offered through individuals providing voluntary support to the network.
    
    Currently the Oxen Privacy Tech Foundation offers free Lokinet exit node access at address "exit.loki". A wiki for Lokinet is located at https://wiki.oxen.io/wiki/Main_Page

Botspot<br />
Package app

    Open-source version of Google Chrome.
    If you are using Raspberry Pi OS, this browser has been optimized by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to include hardware acceleration and other various performance improvements.
    
    To play Netflix, Spotify, or other protected multimedia streams, see the Chromium Widevine app.
    To install an older version of Chromium, see the Downgrade Chromium app.
    
    Chromium supports numerous flags to enable extra features. You can add these flags either manually (by running chromium-browser in a terminal), or by adding the flag to a file in the /etc/chromium/customizations folder.
    Here's how that works: Inside the /etc/chromium/customizations folder there will be one or more files. On most systems there will already be a 00-rpi-vars file there. You can add flags to it, or create a new file. In all cases, be sure it starts with:
    CHROMIUM_FLAGS="${CHROMIUM_FLAGS}
    And be sure it ends with this character: "
    
    Now that you know how to add flags to Chromium, here are some useful ones:
    - Enable Google Chrome Sync: --oauth2-client-id=77185425430.apps.googleusercontent.com --oauth2-client-secret=OTJgUOQcT7lO7GsGZq2G4IlT
        This flag is discussed in the Raspberry Pi Forums: https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=314477
    - Enable dark mode: --force-dark-mode
        If you want more themes, go visit the Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/themes
    - Change the scale of the browser window: --force-device-scale-factor=1.3
        The default is 1 - smaller values will shrink the interface, while larger values will grow the interface.
    - More chromium flags can be found on this website: https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches

    Chromium 65, 72, 74, 78, 84, 86, 88, 92, and 95.
    Uninstall the app to go back to the latest Chromium version available.
    Beware that downgrading Chromium versions can mess up your config folder. To be safe, this app makes a backup of Chromium's config folder. When uninstalling, you will have the opportunity to restore the backup config folder.
    Using older browser versions can be a security risk, proceed with caution.

    Widevine DRM support for any version of chromium-browser.
    This adds ChromeOS's Widevine video decoding library to Chromium, and creates a second menu button with a ChromeOS user-agent. All websites will think your Pi is a Chromebook!
    Unlike Ventz's Chromium Media Edition, or even the official libwidevinecdm0 package, this app is unique to support all versions of Chromium, before version 84 and after version 84. Feel free to downgrade your browser for better video performance! (Using the "Downgrade Chromium" app)
    
    To run: Menu -> Internet -> Chromium Widevine.
    To test DRM: https://bitmovin.com/demos/drm
    For normal browsing, it's advisable to use the standard Chromium launcher.

Package app

    Feature-rich screen recorder for X11 and OpenGL
    Simple Screen Recorder is, despite its name, an actually feature-rich screen recorder. The name reflects the fact that it is simple to use unlike many other free screen recording applications available. It can be easily configured to start recording from an intuitive wizard-like interface.
    
    It can record the entire screen or part of it directly.  The recording can be paused and resumed at any time. Many different file formats and codecs are supported. To perform an X11 recording, all it takes is selecting an area on the root window with the mouse, choosing an output file and pressing record, either by using the mouse or using a hotkey.
    
    It has a Qt-based graphical user interface.
    
    Its complexity becomes apparent in its powerful features. It allows one to record X11 screen areas and fullscreen OpenGL applications including sound supporting both ALSA, PulseAudio, JACK and OSS. It uses libavformat to encode the recorded material into a variety of video formats. Scaling the recorded video is possible as well as configuring the encoding quality for the codec chosen directly from the user interface.

    Box64 lets you run x86_64 Linux programs (such as games) on non-x86_64 Linux systems, like ARM (host system needs to be 64bit little-endian).
    
    Because Box64 uses the native versions of some "system" libraries, like libc, libm, SDL, and OpenGL, it's easy to integrate and use with most applications, and performance can be surprisingly high in many cases.

ARM32/ARM64

    Of course Pi-Apps lets you download more RAM!
    This app sets up ZRAM and a swapfile.
    ZRAM compresses the data stored in RAM, thereby increasing the capacity. Swap allows RAM to overflow to the disk, only if absolutely necessary.
    These modifications prevent the system from locking up under heavy memory usage. Under low memory usage, neither ZRAM nor swap are used.
    
    How much RAM do you get?
    - ZRAM will double the total capacity available. (4GB of ZRAM on a 4GB Pi, 1GB on a 1GB Pi)
    - Swap will add 1GB of overflow capacity. This will be skipped if your SD card is nearly full. (<2GB free space)

ARM32 ONLY

    Open source disk encryption software
    - Creates a virtual encrypted disk within a file and mounts it as a real disk.
    - Encrypts an entire partition or storage device such as USB flash drive or hard drive.
    - Encrypts a partition or drive where Windows is installed (pre-boot authentication).
    - Encryption is automatic, real-time(on-the-fly) and transparent.
    - Parallelization and pipelining allow data to be read and written as fast as if the drive was not encrypted.
    - Encryption can be hardware-accelerated on modern processors.
    - Provides plausible deniability, in case an adversary forces you to reveal the password: Hidden volume (steganography) and hidden operating system.
    - More information about the features of VeraCrypt may be found in the documentation.

    Install Windows 10 or Windows 11 on a Raspberry Pi SD card.
    This tool is a 100% legal way to use any Debian or Ubuntu Linux operating system to flash a RPi's SD card with the necessary files to run Windows 10 or 11.
    
    Usage is simple:
    - Choose an operating system version. (Windows 11, Windows 10, Custom version)
    - Choose what model Pi will be running Windows. (RPi4 or RPi3)
    - Choose a language.
    - Choose a storage drive to flash.
    - Click Flash.
    It's as simple as that. WoR-flasher takes care of the rest - downloading hundreds of files from Microsoft, generating a Windows image with them, importing the custom RPi drivers, enabling the WinPE environment, and much more. When finished, WoR-flasher will tell you exactly what to do next.
    
    To run: Menu -> Accessories -> WoR-Flasher
    To run the graphical interface in a terminal: ~/wor-flasher/install-wor-gui.sh
    To run the command-line interface in a terminal: ~/wor-flasher/install-wor.sh
    
    If you encounter problems, we recommend you run WoR-flasher in a terminal to catch any errors.

<https://www.winehq.org/> - Script by Itai-Nelken and Botspot<br />
ARM32 ONLY

    Run x86 Windows apps with a box86-emulated version of x86 wine.
    To run: wine path/to/file.exe
    To configure wine: go to 'Wine configuration' in main menu or type in terminal: wine winecfg
    Not all Windows applications will work under Wine. It's a good idea to check online if your program can run, or if something can be tweaked to make it work.
    
    Note: the applications installed with wine will appear under the wine category in the main menu, and they will stay there even after uninstalling wine.
